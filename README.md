# Secret Santa
Simple secret santa python script.
If you got an assertion error when running the script, just run it again (the last email ended up matching with itself). 
CSV file must be named "list.csv", and be like this : 
|name1|name2|name3|
|-----|-----|-----|
|email1|email2|email3|

which is identical to : 
```
name1,name2,name3
email1,email2,email3
```

**You have to turn on _Allow less secure apps to ON_ on your google account.** Be careful, it could be dangerous. I recommend creating a gmail account just for this script, do not use your personal email.
